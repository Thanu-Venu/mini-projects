## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User selects a future **date & time**.  
2. Click **Start** → timer begins counting down.  
3. **Pause** stops the countdown; **Resume** continues it.  
4. **Reset** clears the timer.  
5. **Sound alert** plays when countdown reaches zero.  
6. **Linear progress bar** decreases as time passes.  
7. Timer automatically saves in browser storage and resumes on page refresh.
