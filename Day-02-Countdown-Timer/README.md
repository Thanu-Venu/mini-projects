🛠️ How It Works

User selects a future date & time.

Click Start → timer begins counting down.

Pause stops the countdown; Resume continues it.

Reset clears the timer.

Sound alert plays when countdown reaches zero.

Linear progress bar decreases as time passes.

Circular progress circle animates around the timer.

Timer automatically saves in browser storage and resumes on page refresh.
