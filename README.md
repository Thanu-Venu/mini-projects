# 🌟 30-Day Mini Web Project Challenge

Welcome to my **30-Day Mini Web Project Challenge**!  
The goal of this challenge is to build 30 small but powerful web projects in 30 days, improving my skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX, and API integration**.

I’ll be creating **one project every day** and uploading it to this repository.  
By the end of 30 days, I will have a solid portfolio and stronger coding consistency.
